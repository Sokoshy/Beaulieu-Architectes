# Beaulieu Architect

This is my school project for red thread project.

This was a project in which we had to design from scratch.

First I carried out an audit, then a customer questionnaire, and then I responded to the customer's
problem and provided him with a product that best met his needs.

(The customer was a fictitious client for the project).
